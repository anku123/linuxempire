Here is the Python tutorial....
maybe you are wondering that what is Python language and who wrote it.... 
This tutorial will teach you basics of Python, its syntax, codes and everything....

Python was developed by Guido van Rossum in the early nineties at the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands.

Python is available under GPL (Gnu General Public Licence).

Want to download Python and install it in windows operating system?
Here is a small tutorial about downloading and installing python in windows. 
1. Download suitable version of Python from this website: http://www.python.org/download/releases/
2. .msi file will be downloaded. Just double click on it, install it in a normal way.
3.  set the environment variable: Open command, type this command
path %path%;C:\Python
4. And you are set. Open Idle(GUI editor for python). start coding :)

What is Python? 
Python is a general purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented and high-level programming language.Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code

Types of comments: 
They are:
Single line comments: Used with a hash tag (#).
Multiple line comments: Used with double quotation mark (").

We will be using these comments in the following Python snippets. 

Hello world snippet: 
This hello world program is a basic program in most of the computer languages. Writing that 'hello world' program in Python is very simple. Here is the snippet.
#Hello_world snippet
print "hello, world"; 

Open Python command line, Type print "hello, world"; Press enter and voila! Hello world program in python is compiled and you'll get the output as hello, world. Simple, isn't it?

Script programming: Open any text editor like gedit, emacs, vim (in case of Gnu/linux operating systems) and note pad (in case of windows operating system). Type print "hello, world"; Save the file as hello.py. Open python command line, create path variable to the directory where that file is stored, run this command 
>>>python hell.py
And the output will be hello, world. 

Simple, right? 

And there are arithmetic operators which can be used in an easy way. For example: 
In python command line,
>>> 3 + 5 # gives 8. There is no need to type printf, scanf, c=a+b; statements. It is same case for subtraction, multiplication, division of numbers. It is much easier than C/C++/Java.

Strings can be created by using " or ' or " " "
Example:
word = 'word' 
sentence = "This is a sentence." 
paragraph = " " "This is a paragraph. It is made up of multiple lines and sentences." " "

Using reserved words in Python: 
Some of the reserved words are And, Exec, Not, Assert, Finally, Or, Break, For, Pass, Class, From etc. 
All the Python keywords contain lowercase letters only.

We use if, elif, else for control flow:
Example:
if x/2 = 0
print "x is a even number"
elif 
print "x is a odd number"
else
print "x is neither even number nor odd number";

Python code is human readable code, i.e., humans can read the code and understand it very easily. 

Using loops in Python:
Loop statements are: for, do, while.
example:
1. for town in ["California", "Toronto", "New Delhi"]:
          print "%s is a town" % town

2. while x = 10
         print x;
         x++;


Simple and interesting, right? :)
